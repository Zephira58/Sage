# Sage: Your Personal AI Assistant

![icon](assets\icon.png)

**Sage** is an AI assistant project developed as a passion project by me and my girlfriend. Our goal is to create a system similar to Jarvis from Iron Man, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and various integrations to provide a wide range of functionalities.

## Features

- **LLM Integration**: Will utilize advanced language models to understand and process natural language commands.
- **OSC Integration for VRChat**: Will allows for interaction with VRChat through Open Sound Control (OSC) protocols.
- **Assistant**: Will be able to provide basic functionality when it comes to assisting you, such as reporting your top used processes, collaborating on ideas and so on.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Plans to incorporate TTS capabilities using tools like Piper or 11labs for vocal responses. Which will allow you to have vocal responses.
- **Modular System**: Designed to support additional modules, enabling users to add custom commands and features in the future. To their own discretion.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT) Support**: Future plans include adding STT capabilities for voice command input to enable dynamic conversions.

## Current Status
This project is in its early stages, with minimal to no features currently implemented.
