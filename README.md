# Sage: Your Personal AI Assistant

![icon](https://github.com/Zephira58/sage/blob/main/assets/icon.png?raw=true)

**Sage** is an AI assistant project developed as a passion project by me and my girlfriend. Our goal is to create a system similar to Jarvis from Iron Man, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and various integrations to provide a wide range of functionalities.

## Features

- **LLM Integration**: Will utilize advanced language models to understand and process natural language commands.
- **OSC Integration for VRChat**: Will allows for interaction with VRChat through Open Sound Control (OSC) protocols.
- **Assistant**: Will be able to provide basic functionality when it comes to assisting you, such as reporting your top used processes, collaborating on ideas and so on.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Plans to incorporate TTS capabilities using tools like Piper or 11labs for vocal responses. Which will allow you to have vocal responses.
- **Modular System**: Designed to support additional modules, enabling users to add custom commands and features in the future. To their own discretion.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT) Support**: Future plans include adding STT capabilities for voice command input to enable dynamic conversions.

## Current Status
This project is in its early stages, with minimal to no features currently implemented.

# üíª Sage: Your Personal AI Assistant - TUI Powered

Sage is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to provide intelligent AI assistance in a simple and efficient text-based user interface (TUI). As a TUI application, Sage focuses on delivering a smooth and seamless experience for users who prefer working in a terminal environment. The beauty of using a TUI for Sage lies in its simplicity and direct access to powerful AI functionalities.

## Why TUI?

Using a TUI for Sage allows for a lightweight and distraction-free experience. It empowers users to interact with the AI assistant directly through commands and receive quick responses, making it ideal for power users who value efficiency and speed. The text-based interface not only ensures the system remains fast but also offers greater control and customization for those who prefer working in terminal environments.

Whether you are managing tasks, getting information, or collaborating with the assistant, the TUI setup enables Sage to perform efficiently while maintaining minimal system resource usage. This approach makes it possible to use Sage in environments where GUI tools may be impractical or unavailable, while still providing an intelligent assistant that responds to commands and integrates with external tools like VRChat and LLMs.

Sage brings AI assistance directly to your terminal, helping you stay productive without ever leaving the command line.
